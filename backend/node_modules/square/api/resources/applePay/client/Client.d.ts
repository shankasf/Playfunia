     * Activates a domain for use with Apple Pay on the Web and Square. A validation
     * is performed on this domain by Apple to ensure that it is properly set up as
     * an Apple Pay enabled domain.
     *
     * This endpoint provides an easy way for platform developers to bulk activate
     * Apple Pay on the Web with Square for merchants using their platform.
     *
     * Note: You will need to host a valid domain verification file on your domain to support Apple Pay.  The
     * current version of this file is always available at https://app.squareup.com/digital-wallets/apple-pay/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association,
     * and should be hosted at `.well_known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` on your
     * domain.  This file is subject to change; we strongly recommend checking for updates regularly and avoiding
     * long-lived caches that might not keep in sync with the correct file version.
     *
