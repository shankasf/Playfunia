     * __Note:__ This endpoint is used by the deprecated Reader SDK.
     * Developers should update their integration to use the [Mobile Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mobile-payments-sdk), which includes its own authorization methods.
     *
     * Generates code to authorize a mobile application to connect to a Square card reader.
     *
     * Authorization codes are one-time-use codes and expire 60 minutes after being issued.
     *
     * The `Authorization` header you provide to this endpoint must have the following format:
     *
     * ```
     * Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
     * ```
     *
     * Replace `ACCESS_TOKEN` with a
     * [valid production authorization credential](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/access-tokens).
